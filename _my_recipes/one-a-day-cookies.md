* 125g unsalted butter, softened
* 100g (80) caster sugar
* 100g (80) soft muscovado sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 100g wholemeal flour (bread flour ok)
* 150g lightly toasted seeds (pumpkin, sunflower and linseed. More sunflower than others)
* 100g good-quality rolled oats (not the stuff that resembles sawdust)

Toast seeds in a tray in the oven for about 8 minutes. 
Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/gas mark 5Â½. Beat together the butter and the two sugars, then add the egg and beat to combine. Stir in the vanilla, then lightly beat in the other ingredients.
Divide the mixture into 12-14 pieces (they should be roughly the size of a golf ball) and then flatten them a little with the palm of your hand as you lay out six pieces on a greased baking sheet. (You bake only six at a time because they cookies will spread out to twice their original diameter.)

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly brown at the edges.
Remove from the oven, leave to cool for a minute, then, using a spatula, carefully lift and transfer them to a cooling rack. Once cold, store in a paper bag or an airtight container.
