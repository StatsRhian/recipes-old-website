* 200g self-raising flour
* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 50g caster sugar
* 1 egg
* 50g melted butter
* 250ml milk
* 125g cottage cheese
* 225g blueberries
* 15g unsalted butter

Mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and sugar together in a bowl.

In a separate bowl combine one egg with the 50g melted butter, milk and cottage cheese then add this to the flour mix and stir together to make a batter.

Stir in the blueberries.

Lightly oil a frying pan and preheat over a medium heat. Spoon a small ladleful of the pancake batter into the pan and cook for one minute on each side, until golden.
