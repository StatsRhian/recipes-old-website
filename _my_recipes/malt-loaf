I used 350g flour, 190 tea, 120g malt, 20 syrup, 40 molasses, 50 soft sugar, 200 dried fruit (prunes, raisins, sultanas). No fat or egg. 3tsp baking powder, 1/2 t salt.
2lb loaf tin - plenty of room. Good but less flour would be more moist (see recipes). 175C - cooked quickly.
 
Later attempt tried 300g flour. This was good but dough was a bit wet. I think try 180ml for 300 flour

* 300g flour
* 180ml tea
* 120g malt extract plus extra to glaze
* 20 syrup
* 40 molasses
* 50g soft brown sugar
* 200g dried fruit (prunes, raisins, sultanas) 


Stir together the malt extract, treacle, sugar and tea, then add the dried fruit. Leave to soak for 15 minutes.
Line a 2lb loaf tin with paper and heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark four.
Stir flour into the mixture to make a soft batter. Spoon into the tin and bake for an hour, until a skewer comes out cleanish (the top will bow, don't worry!).
Paint the top with malt extract and leave to cool in the tin.
