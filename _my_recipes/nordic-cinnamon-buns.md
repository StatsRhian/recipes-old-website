Makes 12-13

For the dough

* lukewarm milk 570ml
* caster sugar 150g
* fresh yeast 45g (or easy-blend dried yeast, according to manufacturer's instructions)
* cardamom seeds 1 tsp, crushed with a pestle and mortar
* unsalted butter 180g, melted
* egg 1
* plain flour 1 kg

For the filling

* unsalted butter 100g, softened at room temperature
* dark brown soft sugar 200g
* ground cinnamon 3 tbsp

For the glaze
* caster sugar 85g
* freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tbsp

To make the dough, put the milk, sugar, yeast, cardamom, melted butter and egg in a food processor or mixer with a dough hook. With the motor running, gradually add the flour until it is all incorporated and the dough has come together. Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
After an hour, punch down the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll it out until it is about 30cm x 80cm and 7mm thick.

For the filling, spread the butter evenly over the dough and sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon all over the top.
Roll the dough up from a long side. Cut into roughly 6cm rolls, but cut them at an angle â€“ so, make the first cut diagonally, then the second cut about 6cm along diagonally in the opposite direction. You should get a roll that looks like a trapezium (or a triangle with the tip chopped off). Carefully transfer the buns to the prepared baking trays, with the longest edge of the bun sitting on the tray, cover with tea towels again and leave to prove in a warm place for 30-60 minutes, until almost doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Bake the buns in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
To make the glaze, put the sugar, lemon juice and 100ml water in a small pan and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until slightly thickened. The glaze will be quite watery.
Remove the buns from the oven, transfer to a wire rack and brush the glaze generously over them. Leave them to cool before serving.
