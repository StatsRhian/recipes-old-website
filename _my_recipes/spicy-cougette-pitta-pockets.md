# Spicy Cougette Pitta Pockets

- 1 courgette, trimmed and thinly sliced lengthways
- 2 tsp harissa paste
- 2 tsp olive oil
- small handful broad beans(fresh or frozen)
- 2 tbsp houmous
- 1 spring onion, finely sliced
- 1 tsp tahini paste
- small garlic clove, crushed
- squeeze lemon juice
- 1 tbsp Greek-style yogurt
- 1 large wholemeal pitta bread

Toss the courgette slices in the harissa and olive oil, and season.
Cook on a hot griddle pan for 2 mins each side or until tender. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Cook the broad beans in boiling water for 2 mins, drain under cold running water, then slip them out of their outer skins. Discard the skins. Put the broad beans, houmous and spring onion in a small bowl and mix to combine.
In another bowl, mix the tahini, garlic, lemon juice and yogurt. Toast the pitta and split it to create 2 pockets. Spoon the houmous mix inside each pocket, followed by the spicy courgette slices and a drizzle of the yogurt mixture.
