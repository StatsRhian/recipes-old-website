<p>Here is a list of recipes that James and I often use. I intend to update this list by catergorising recipes at a later date. </p>

<h1>List of Recipes</h1>

{% for recipes in site.my_recipes %}


<a href="{{ recipes.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
        <h3>{{ recipes.title }}</h3>
</a>
{% endfor %}
